# interface
This script will generate a heatmap with interface between two proteins subunit which are at 4 A from each other.

This script was initiated by Thomas Newport and then Viwan Jarerattanachat and myself are adapting this together within the SBCB. 

This script is now operating with python3.

To use :

python interface_clean.py PDB_file XTC_file output

This should give :

a) output.dat file 
b) output.csv file
c) a heatmap for you to play and zoom in/out
